# Hello World

This post is how I set up my mac

I tried to install Git via the command line. I got an error saying that 

"xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools."

I googled how to set up a mac for development and found this [guide](https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/mac-setup/)

It needed me to create an admin account. I googled and found a [guide](https://www.lifewire.com/add-administrator-accounts-to-mac-os-x-2260717)

It turns out that as the only user I am already an admin ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
